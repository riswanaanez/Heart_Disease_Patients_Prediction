# **Prediction of Class of Mushroom using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on predicting the class of mushrooms using various supervised machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## **Overview**

The project implements the following steps:

1. **Data Setup**: Importing datasets and essential libraries.
2. **Data Cleaning and Encoding:** Preprocessing the data and encoding categorical features using Label Encoder.
3. **Data Partitioning:** Splitting the dataset into input and output features.
4. **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the data for accurate model evaluation.
5. **Data Normalization:** Normalizing data using Standard Scaler normalization.
6. **Model Creation:** Implementing KNN (with k value set to 7), Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers.
7. **Performance Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports (including recall, precision, and F1-score).

## **Insight**

The models exhibit accurate predictions with the following accuracies:

- K-Nearest Neighbor:1.0
- Naive Bayes:0.89
- Support Vector Machine: 1.0
